# Tests Using the cvc5 Solver

These tests demonstrate the usage of the API and test your installation of `cvc5`. These are meant to be run after an installation of `smt-switch`.

To install `smt-switch` with `cvc5`, you would run the following from the top-level directory:
`sudo make install install-cvc5`

# Dependencies

We have tried to automate dependency installations for unusual packages, but we have not installed all the `cvc5` dependencies that you can rely on a package manager for. If your build is not working, please see the installation instructions on the `cvc5` [github](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5/).
